  Viesturs Portfolio
</h1>
<h2>by Jean Tiston</h2>

I designed and built this with Gatsby for my own portfolio which you can view at https://dev.jeanlouise.co/
Used Framer Motion for the animation, Contentful for CMS and Netlify for deploying the project.

You can view the Figma mockup below:

    ```shell
    npm init gatsby
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.
