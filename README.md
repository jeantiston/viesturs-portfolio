  Viesturs Portfolio
</h1>
<h2>by Jean Tiston</h2>

I designed and built this with Gatsby for my own portfolio which you can view at https://dev.jeanlouise.co/
Used Framer Motion for the animation, Contentful for CMS and Netlify for deploying the project.

You can view the [Figma mockup here](https://www.figma.com/file/ZIOsxYKlsiSqAu5lHeaHye/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1).

## ðŸš€ Start developing

1.  **Install Gatsby.**

    New to Gatsby? Dive into this [quick start guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start).

    ```shell
    npm init gatsby
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd viesturs-portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
